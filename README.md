dotnet restore
dotnet run
```

1. 'Assets names only' and 'Asset names with last price' lists are rendered side-by-side, both have data

2. Navigate to any other page

3. Return to Home

### Epected result
Both lists should load and display the data as in step 1

### Actual result
Only 'Asset names with last price' list displays the data, the other list is stuck on 'Loading...'
